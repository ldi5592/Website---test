<p>Wheather its species, people or places, WWF is working hard to support
   and provide for things that need it. tigers, lions and hippos are just
   some examples of species that WWF is working to protect. Forest, fresh
   water and oceans come under places that we are trying to protect. We
   chose which locations to help based on the wealth and variety of life
   they support, the destructive challenges they face, and our ability
   to positively impact them.</p>
